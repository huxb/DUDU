Layout of website 
    notebar
    topbar(1)
    navbar(999)

    content(1)
        carousell
        link | content

    footer
        skirt(-1)
        links(1)

z-index are set in style using position-* class

Apparently there is no way to share data between apps, had to construct contact info twice

Problems:
Footer would load with 600+ offsetHeight until page is clicked on
